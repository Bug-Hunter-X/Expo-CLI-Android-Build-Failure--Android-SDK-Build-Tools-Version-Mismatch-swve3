The solution involves updating or specifying the Android SDK build tools version.  This can be done in a few ways:

**1. Using the Expo CLI's built-in tools:** Expo CLI may have commands to manage the Android SDK. Refer to the Expo documentation for commands that help update the SDK.

**2. Manually updating the Android SDK:**  Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessible through the Android Studio SDK Manager) and update the build-tools package to a compatible version mentioned in the error message or the Expo documentation.

**3. Specifying the build tools version in your project (less common):**  While less usual, some projects might allow you to explicitly specify the build tools version in their build configuration files (e.g., `gradle.properties`).  Refer to your project's documentation for this approach if necessary.

**Example (Illustrative):** The following example shows a potential error message and how to address it using the SDK Manager:

Error Message (Example):
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.
> Android resource linking failed
...caused by: com.android.ide.common.internal.LoggedErrorException: Failed to run command:
[...Error details indicating version mismatch...]
```

Solution (using SDK Manager): Open the Android SDK Manager and locate the 'Android SDK Build-Tools' section.  Look for the version number indicated in the error message and either update to it or select a compatible version recommended by Expo documentation. Then rebuild your app.
